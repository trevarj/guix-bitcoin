# Reproducibility & bootstrapping

This channel serves no binary substitutes — every package is built from source
on your machine. This guide shows how to build and verify a node, and how to
bootstrap its whole toolchain from Guix's 357-byte seed — matching, and going
beyond, Bitcoin Core's reproducible-build philosophy.

## Vs. Bitcoin Core

Bitcoin Core's release builds (`contrib/guix/` + `bitcoin-core/guix.sigs`) use
Guix to produce reproducible binaries that multiple builders attest to, pinning
a Guix revision and trusting Guix's toolchain. Here you are your own builder: you
compile from source locally and verify the build is bit-for-bit reproducible.

## What "no substitutes" covers

| Layer | Built locally from source? |
|-------|----------------------------|
| Bitcoin apps (bitcoin-core, electrs, lnd, …) | Always — the channel ships no app binaries |
| Dependencies (boost, gcc, glibc, …) | Only with `--no-substitutes`; otherwise from `ci.guix.gnu.org` |
| Bootstrap chain | With `--no-substitutes`, built from the 357-byte `hex0` source up; only `guile-bootstrap` (~25 MB) stays a downloaded binary |

## Build from source

```sh
guix build -L . bitcoin-core
```

Compiles bitcoin-core locally; dependencies come from `ci.guix.gnu.org`. Minutes.

## Build everything from source

```sh
guix build -L . --no-substitutes bitcoin-core
```

Builds the whole dependency graph locally — no server trusted for any package
output. Hours, and tens of GB of store on first run.

## Verify reproducibility

Build the package twice (or re-check a store copy) and fail if the outputs
differ — this works for the channel's own packages, with no external reference:

```sh
guix build -L . --rounds=2 --keep-failed bitcoin-core
guix build -L . --check --keep-failed bitcoin-core
```

Wrapper script: [`examples/verify-bitcoin-core.sh`](../examples/verify-bitcoin-core.sh).

## Full-source bootstrap

On `x86_64-linux`/`i686-linux`, `bitcoin-core`'s C toolchain roots in a 357-byte
`hex0` seed, with no prebuilt compiler trusted in between (`guile-bootstrap`,
~25 MB, drives the builds). This goes beyond Bitcoin Core's own reproducible
builds, which trust Guix's prebuilt toolchain.

Prove the dependency graph reaches the seed:

```sh
guix graph -L . -t bag bitcoin-core | grep stage0-posix
```

`stage0-posix` carries `hex0`; the downloaded binary toolchain seeds
(`%bootstrap-gcc`, `%bootstrap-glibc`) do not appear in the graph. The
`--no-substitutes` build above compiles every rung below from source.

### The chain

Each rung is compiled by the previous one (versions from the current graph):

| Stage | Packages |
|-------|----------|
| Seed | `stage0-posix@1.6.0` — 357-byte `hex0` → hex1/hex2/M0/M2-Planet + mescc-tools |
| Scheme shell/tools | `bootar`, `gash-boot`, `gash-utils-boot` — Guile `tar`/shell, so no trusted `bash`/coreutils |
| Scheme C compiler | `mes-boot@0.25.1` — GNU Mes + MesCC |
| Real C compiler | `tcc-boot0` → `tcc-boot@0.9.27` — TinyCC, built by MesCC |
| First GCC + glibc | `binutils-mesboot0@2.20.1a` → `gcc-core-mesboot0@2.95.3` → `glibc-mesboot0@2.2.5` → `gcc-mesboot0@2.95.3` |
| Iterate toolchain | `gcc-mesboot1@4.6.4` → `binutils-mesboot@2.20.1a` → `glibc-mesboot@2.16.0` → `gcc-mesboot@4.9.4` |
| GNU userland | `bash-mesboot`, `coreutils-mesboot@9.1`, `sed-mesboot`, `grep-mesboot`, `gawk-mesboot`, `tar-mesboot`, `xz-mesboot`, `gzip-mesboot`, `make-mesboot` |
| Final toolchain | Guix's modern gcc / glibc / binutils / guile |
| Node deps | cmake, boost, libevent, sqlite, … |
| **Node** | **bitcoin-core** |

### Building it

```sh
# Everything from the seed up. Hours to a day-plus; x86 only.
guix build -L . --no-substitutes bitcoin-core

# Inspect any single rung:
guix build -e '(@@ (gnu packages commencement) stage0-posix)'
guix build -e '(@@ (gnu packages commencement) mes-boot)'
guix build -e '(@@ (gnu packages commencement) gcc-mesboot)'
```

The early rungs (`hex0` → `gcc-mesboot`) are largely single-threaded — the slow
part. See `info "(guix) Full-Source Bootstrap"`.

## Expected reproducibility

Verify per release with `--rounds=2`:

- C++/CMake (bitcoin-core, bitcoin-knots): reproducible — built with the GUI off
  (no Qt) and `BITCOIN_GENBUILD_NO_GIT=1`.
- Go (btcd, lnd): reproducible.
- Rust (electrs, bdk-cli): reproducible.

## Attestation

Reproducibility proves "this source yields this binary"; attestation adds "and
independent builders got the same binary." That compares one exact derivation,
so it must be the *same* build — have others build this channel's `bitcoin-core`
and compare hashes. The `reproduce` workflow does exactly this: it builds a
package with `--rounds=2` and publishes its `SHA256SUMS`:

```sh
gh workflow run reproduce.yml -f package=bitcoin-core
```

Bitcoin Core's own `guix.sigs` attests a *different* artifact: its release
binaries are cross-compiled and statically linked via Core's `contrib/guix`
process, so their hashes do not match this channel's natively built, dynamically
linked package. Verify Core's official downloads against `guix.sigs` separately
if you want those — it is not comparable to the from-source build here.
